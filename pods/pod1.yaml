## Notes ##
# 1) Specifies the Kubernetes API version to use. For a Pod, v1 is the correct API version.
# 2) Defines the type of Kubernetes object to be created. In this case, it is a Pod.
# 3) Pod is the smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes and can contain one or more containers.
# 4) Labels are key-value pairs that help in organizing and selecting resources. 
# 5) Here, "run: nginx-pod" is a label assigned to the Pod, which can be used for selection or filtering within the cluster.
# 6) Specifies the "name: nginx-pod", which makes it easier to identify within the cluster.
# 7) spec: This is where the specification for the Podâ€™s desired state is defined, including the containers it will run.
# 8) A list of containers to run in the Pod. In this example, only one container is defined.
# 9) Specifies the container image to use, which is the latest version of Nginx from the Docker registry.
# 10) Provides a name for the container within the Pod. It helps in distinguishing this container from others if the Pod contains multiple containers.
